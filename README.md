### Sequential Thermal-Structural Simulation of Defect Restoration

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the feasibility of using Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) to repair a high-stress stainless steel bracket subjected to mechanical loading in pump applications.

A sequential thermal–structural finite element analysis was conducted in ANSYS to compare:

1. Defect-free bracket
2. Bracket with crack/defect
3. Bracket repaired using WAAM (Element Birth & Death)

The study quantifies the structural improvement after additive repair and evaluates stress redistribution, deformation, and strain reduction.

### 🔥 Stress Reduction Achieved

- Equivalent Stress ↓ ~97%
- Normal Stress ↓ ~96%
- Significant deformation reduction

The repaired geometry redistributed stress effectively and eliminated sharp stress concentrators.
